If you use this mod let me know! It's my second one and I'd love to get some feedback.

Also check out the sister mod, [Felling](https://github.com/arlyon/felling), which adds a similar enchantment to cut down entire trees at once.

## Usage

Veining is a very simple mod, and fits very well into the original feeling of the game. 
The mod introduces a new enchantment to the world, Veining. It can be enchanted on any pickaxe and 
when mining veins, destroys the entire vein at once. It is quite rare (occurring about half the time 
with a good number of bookshelves) and works just like you would expect any other enchantment to.

## Support / Compatibility

This mod has been tested on Minecraft 1.12. It may work on other versions but you'll have to test it yourself.

Additionally, the enchantment is compatible with any modded tool that uses the "pickaxe" tool class, as well as all ores that are properly registered in the Ore Dictionary.

Tested and confirmed (or coded to be) compatible:

- Thermal Expansion
- Immersive Engineering
- Forestry
- IndustrialCraft
- Actually Additions
- Quark

## Installation

Assuming you have Forge Mod Loader on a compatible version of Minecraft:

- Open your .minecraft folder
- Drop the jar file in your mods folder
- (optionally) look at the configuration options
- ???
- Profit

When you have done this, the enchantment will be available in game. 

## Mod Packs

Feel free to use this in any mod-pack you please. I would appreciate a small mention back to this page but it's not 
necessary. Lastly, it would be cool if you send me a link to your pack so I can check it out!
